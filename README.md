# Car Body Type Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using transfer learning with the Xception architecture to classify car images into different body types. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze car images and predict their body type accurately. The key car body types included in this project are Hatchback, SUV, Sedan, Truck, Sport, and Van.

## Dataset

- **Size:** 4,344 images.
- **Features:**
  - **Image:** The car image to classify.
  - **Label:** The true car body type, which could be (Hatchback, SUV, Sedan, Truck, Sport, Van)
